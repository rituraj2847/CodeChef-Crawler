# CodeChef-Crawler
<h2>Basic Usage</h2> 
<p>
1. To use this you'll need BeautifulSoup library installed on your machine. Download it using the command<br>
'$ sudo apt-get install python3-bs4' <br>
2. Just navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded this.<br>
3. Type '$ python3.5 crawl2.py'. Hit enter in your terminal. <br>
4. Now just enter the username of the user whose answers you have to fetch.<br>
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
1. Creates a user directory with the username and saves each file with the question code name. <br>
2. Supports JAVA, C, C++ and python formats. All the other file types are downloaded as .txt files. <br>
3. Gives the ongoing fetching details along with the time taken to fetch each answer.<br>
</p>
I would highly appreciate any suggestions and pull requests aimed at improving the Crawler.
